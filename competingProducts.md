- Users send a Spot Link via calendar invite just as you would with Zoom or Microsoft Teams, 
- instead of sitting down for a video call, users are able to put on their headphones and put their phone in their pocket. 
- Spot records the call, and uses a virtual assistant to take notes. 
- Users can say "Spot, fetch" (or press a button on the screen) and Spot will automatically transcribe the last 40 seconds of the call.
- Spot also has a collaborative notes section where attendees can write out the meeting's agenda and jot down other notes in real time.
